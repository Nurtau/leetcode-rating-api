# leetcode-rating-api
## Overview
* Created a REST API which tracks the number of solved leetcode problems by users and returns an appropriate rating. 
* Used *Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB*.
* Increased an API performance by about 15 times by switching from web scraping to GraphQL during fetching data.
* Old version of this project web scraped leetcode accounts by using Puppeteer to get scores.
* This REST API is consumed by [front end](https://github.com/Nurtau/leetcode-rating) which deployed [here](https://leetcode-rating.vercel.app).
